Some of the benefits of a static website generators are that they are:

- **Simple** -
There are basically two main types of website – Static and Dynamic. A static site is one that is usually written in plain HTML and what is in the code of the page is what is displayed to the user.
- **Fast**:
A dynamic site is one that is written using a server-side scripting language such as PHP, ASP, JSP, or Coldfusion. In such a site the content is called in by the scripting language from other files or from a database depending on actions taken by the user.
- **Felxible**,
Flexibility is the main advantage of a static site – every page can be different if desired, to match the layout to different content, and the designer is free to put in any special effects that a client may ask for in a unique way on different pages. This allows theming – for instance an author may want a different theme for a different book and associated pages or perhaps for a series of books, in order to match the cover designs or the context of the stories.
- **Have Versioning** - There are a range of benefits associated with static websites. A few of them are:

1. It is usually cheaper to put into action on a smaller sized scale if fewer pages are needed.
2. Great for smaller businesses as you don’t have for any administrative system.
3. Very simple to create website and hosting the website.
4. Available at economic cost.
5. Best for small scale enterprises.
6. Consumes less time for designing and development
7. Easily to optimize the website
8. User-friendly to update the website with little HTML knowledge
9. Client can go with his own design Idea.
10. No cost involved in maintenance

- **Previewable**: Because static sites are developed locally, you can play around with the site to you heart's content without affecting the live site.
